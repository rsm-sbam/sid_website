Specifically, we evaluated differences in: mrm2: months since last donation hpa: highest previous contribution years: number of years since first donation female: gender In each case, the t-test and regression results matched exactly, confirming that both methods are statistically equivalent when comparing group means in randomized experiments. None of the variables showed statistically significant differences at the 95% confidence level — all p-values were well above 0.05. This means we cannot reject the null hypothesis that these variables are balanced across groups, which reinforces the success of the random assignment process. The only variable with a marginal p-value was female (p = 0.076), which is still not significant at the 95% level and likely reflects random variation rather than systematic bias. This kind of analysis corresponds to Table 1 in Karlan & List (2007), which is included in the paper to reassure readers that treatment and control groups were balanced prior to intervention. This is crucial because it validates that any observed effects on donation behavior can be causally attributed to the treatment, not pre-existing differences between the groups."

The t-test results show that the difference in donation rates between the groups is statistically significant at the 1% level, with treatment recipients donating at a higher rate. Specifically, the treatment group had an average donation rate of ~2.2%, compared to ~1.8% for the control group. The regression confirms this, estimating a treatment effect of roughly 0.4 percentage points — the exact same difference found in the t-test. While the effect size is relatively small in absolute terms, the statistical significance suggests that this difference is unlikely to be due to random chance. This finding aligns with Panel A of Table 2a in Karlan & List (2007), which similarly reports a statistically significant increase in response due to treatment. From a behavioral perspective, this result highlights that how a charitable appeal is framed can influence people’s decisions. Even though the economic “ask” is the same, donors appear more likely to give when the appeal includes a matching or challenge element. This could be due to a perception that their donation has more impact, or a psychological trigger related to urgency, social proof, or shared responsibility. In short, presentation matters, and even small nudges in message framing can lead to measurable changes in behavior, especially in the context of fundraising and prosocial giving.\n\n\n# Load package for probit model\nlibrary(stats)\n\n# Run probit regression: Pr(Give) ~ Treatment\nprobit_model &lt;- glm(gave ~ treatment, data = data, family = binomial(link = \"probit\"))\n\n# Display summary\nsummary(probit_model)\n\n\nCall:\nglm(formula = gave ~ treatment, family = binomial(link = \"probit\"), \n    data = data)\n\nCoefficients:\n            Estimate Std.

The estimated coefficient on treatment is 0.087, which is statistically significant at the 1% level (p ≈ 0.0019). This result confirms the pattern shown in Table 3, Column 1 of Karlan & List (2007), where the authors also report a positive and significant treatment effect. The positive sign of the treatment coefficient indicates that receiving a matching or challenge grant letter increases the likelihood of donating, consistent with the findings from the linear regression and t-tests. Although the magnitude of the probit coefficient itself is not directly interpretable in terms of probabilities, its significance and direction confirm that the treatment has a positive impact on the outcome. This result adds further robustness to the conclusion that framing a charitable appeal using matching mechanisms influences behavior, reinforcing the causal interpretation of the treatment effect.\n\n\nDifferences between Match Rates\nNext, I assess the effectiveness of different sizes of matched donations on the response rate.\n\n\n# Filter for treatment group with valid match ratios only\nmatch_data &lt;- data %&gt;%\n  filter(treatment == 1 & (ratio == 1 | ratio2 == 1 | ratio3 == 1)) %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    match_type = case_when(\n      ratio == 1 ~ \"1:1\",\n      ratio2 == 1 ~ \"2:1\",\n      ratio3 == 1 ~ \"3:1\"\n    )\n  )\n\n\n# 2:1 match vs 1:1 match\nt_test_2v1 &lt;- t.test(gave ~ match_type, data = filter(match_data, match_type %in% c(\"1:1\", \"2:1\")))\nprint(\"T-test: 2:1 vs 1:1\")\n\n[1] \"T-test: 2:1 vs 1:1\"\n\nprint(t_test_2v1)\n\n\n    Welch Two Sample t-test\n\ndata:  gave by match_type\nt = -0.96505, df = 22225, p-value = 0.3345\nalternative hypothesis: true difference in means between group 1:1 and group 2:1 is not equal to 0\n95 percent confidence interval:\n -0.005711275  0.001942773\nsample estimates:\nmean in group 1:1 mean in group 2:1 \n       0.02074912        0.02263338 \n\n# 3:1 match vs 1:1 match\nt_test_3v1 &lt;- t.test(gave ~ match_type, data = filter(match_data, match_type %in% c(\"1:1\", \"3:1\")))\nprint(\"T-test: 3:1 vs 1:1\")\n\n[1] \"T-test: 3:1 vs 1:1\"\n\nprint(t_test_3v1)\n\n\n    Welch Two Sample t-test\n\ndata:  gave by match_type\nt = -1.015, df = 22215, p-value = 0.3101\nalternative hypothesis: true difference in means between group 1:1 and group 3:1 is not equal to 0\n95 percent confidence interval:\n -0.005816051  0.001847501\nsample estimates:\nmean in group 1:1 mean in group 3:1 \n       0.02074912        0.02273340 \n\n\nWe ran t-tests to compare the likelihood of donating under different match ratios within the treatment group: 1:1, 2:1, and 3:1. The results show no statistically significant differences in donation rates between the 1:1 group and either the 2:1 or 3:1 groups. In both comparisons, p-values were well above the 0.05 threshold, and the confidence intervals include zero. These findings support the authors’ statement on page 8 that “the figures suggest that the match offer alone, rather than the size of the match, is the primary driver of increased giving.” In other words, once a match is offered, increasing the match ratio does not lead to significantly higher response rates. This suggests that the behavioral mechanism behind the treatment effect is not a financial calculation of impact, but rather the presence of a match signal itself — which may boost perceived legitimacy, urgency, or moral obligation, regardless of the multiplier.\n\n\n# Create binary indicators\nmatch_data &lt;- match_data %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    ratio1 = ifelse(ratio == 1, 1, 0),\n    ratio2 = ifelse(ratio2 == 1, 1, 0),\n    ratio3 = ifelse(ratio3 == 1, 1, 0)\n  )\n\n# Regression with dummy variables\nmodel_dummies &lt;- lm(gave ~ ratio1 + ratio2 + ratio3, data = match_data)\nsummary(model_dummies)\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = gave ~ ratio1 + ratio2 + ratio3, data = match_data)\n\nResiduals:\n     Min       1Q   Median       3Q      Max \n-0.02273 -0.02273 -0.02263 -0.02075  0.97925 \n\nCoefficients: (1 not defined because of singularities)\n             Estimate Std.

The results show no statistically significant differences in donation likelihood between match sizes. The regression omits the ratio3 variable due to perfect multicollinearity (this happens because all three dummy variables together fully capture the variation in match type — i.e., there’s no baseline). In this setup, the intercept represents the average donation rate for the 3:1 group, and the coefficients on ratio1 and ratio2 reflect the difference in donation likelihood between the 1:1 or 2:1 groups and the 3:1 group. Both coefficients are small and not statistically significant (p &gt; 0.3 and p &gt; 0.95), confirming that increasing the match ratio does not lead to a higher probability of donation. This mirrors our earlier t-test findings and reinforces the authors’ point: the existence of a match, not its magnitude, is what influences behavior. Donors appear to be responding to the presence of a match as a signal or motivator, rather than calculating a greater expected impact based on the match size.\n\n\n# Direct response rate comparison\nmatch_rates &lt;- match_data %&gt;%\n  group_by(match_type) %&gt;%\n  summarise(response_rate = mean(gave, na.rm = TRUE))\n\n# Extract rates\nrate_1to1 &lt;- match_rates$response_rate[match_rates$match_type == \"1:1\"]\nrate_2to1 &lt;- match_rates$response_rate[match_rates$match_type == \"2:1\"]\nrate_3to1 &lt;- match_rates$response_rate[match_rates$match_type == \"3:1\"]\n\n# Differences\ndiff_2v1 &lt;- rate_2to1 - rate_1to1\ndiff_3v2 &lt;- rate_3to1 - rate_2to1\n\n# Print\ncat(\"Difference (2:1 - 1:1):\", diff_2v1, \"\\n\")\n\nDifference (2:1 - 1:1): 0.001884251 \n\ncat(\"Difference (3:1 - 2:1):\", diff_3v2, \"\\n\")\n\nDifference (3:1 - 2:1): 0.000100024 \n\n\n\n# Extract regression coefficients\ncoefs &lt;- coef(model_dummies)\n\n# Differences\ncoef_2v1 &lt;- coefs[\"ratio2\"] - coefs[\"ratio1\"]\ncoef_3v2 &lt;- coefs[\"ratio3\"] - coefs[\"ratio2\"]\n\n# Print\ncat(\"Coefficient Difference (2:1 - 1:1):\", coef_2v1, \"\\n\")\n\nCoefficient Difference (2:1 - 1:1): 0.001884251 \n\ncat(\"Coefficient Difference (3:1 - 2:1):\", coef_3v2, \"\\n\")\n\nCoefficient Difference (3:1 - 2:1): NA \n\n\nWe compared donation response rates across different match ratios both directly from the data and using the regression coefficients from our earlier model. From the raw data, the response rate for the 2:1 match was 0.00188 higher than the 1:1 match, and the difference between 3:1 and 2:1 was only 0.00010 — both extremely small. These exact differences were also reflected in the fitted coefficients of the regression model (with the exception of the 3:1 coefficient, which was excluded due to multicollinearity). The match between the empirical and model-based differences reinforces the reliability of our findings. These results confirm that increasing the match ratio does not substantially increase the likelihood of donation. This supports the paper’s central insight: it’s the presence of a match — not its size — that matters most. Donors are likely influenced by the match offer as a behavioral nudge or psychological signal, rather than through careful evaluation of the multiplier.\n\n\nSize of Charitable Contribution\nIn this subsection, I analyze the effect of the size of matched donation on the size of the charitable contribution.\n\n\n# T-test on amount donated (includes zero for non-donors)\nt_test_amount &lt;- t.test(amount ~ treatment, data = data)\nt_test_amount\n\n\n    Welch Two Sample t-test\n\ndata:  amount by treatment\nt = -1.9183, df = 36216, p-value = 0.05509\nalternative hypothesis: true difference in means between group 0 and group 1 is not equal to 0\n95 percent confidence interval:\n -0.310555423  0.003344493\nsample estimates:\nmean in group 0 mean in group 1 \n      0.8132678       0.9668733 \n\n\n\n# Linear regression: donation amount ~ treatment\nreg_amount &lt;- lm(amount ~ treatment, data = data)\nsummary(reg_amount)\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = amount ~ treatment, data = data)\n\nResiduals:\n   Min     1Q Median     3Q    Max \n -0.97  -0.97  -0.97  -0.81 399.03 \n\nCoefficients:\n            Estimate Std.

The t-test shows a higher mean donation amount in the treatment group ($0.97) compared to the control group ($0.81), but this difference is not statistically significant at the 5% level (p ≈ 0.055). Similarly, the linear regression estimates an increase of $0.15 in average donation for the treatment group, with a p-value of ~0.063 — again, just above the typical threshold for statistical significance. These results suggest that the treatment may have a small positive effect on donation size, but the evidence is not strong enough to draw a firm conclusion. The primary effect of the treatment seems to be on whether a person donates at all, not on how much they donate once they decide to give. This finding reinforces the interpretation that message framing (e.g., offering a match) is more effective at triggering action than at increasing generosity among existing donors. Behavioral nudges can shift decisions, but their effect on donation magnitude appears more limited in this context.\n\n\n# Filter only those who donated\ndonors &lt;- data %&gt;% filter(gave == 1)\n\n# T-test of amount among donors\nt_test_donors &lt;- t.test(amount ~ treatment, data = donors)\nt_test_donors\n\n\n    Welch Two Sample t-test\n\ndata:  amount by treatment\nt = 0.58461, df = 557.46, p-value = 0.559\nalternative hypothesis: true difference in means between group 0 and group 1 is not equal to 0\n95 percent confidence interval:\n -3.937240  7.274027\nsample estimates:\nmean in group 0 mean in group 1 \n       45.54027        43.87188 \n\n\n\n# Linear regression: amount ~ treatment among donors only\nreg_donors &lt;- lm(amount ~ treatment, data = donors)\nsummary(reg_donors)\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = amount ~ treatment, data = donors)\n\nResiduals:\n   Min     1Q Median     3Q    Max \n-43.54 -23.87 -18.87   6.13 356.13 \n\nCoefficients:\n            Estimate Std.

This allows us to assess whether the treatment influenced how much people gave, conditional on choosing to give. Both the t-test and the linear regression show no statistically significant difference in average donation size between treatment and control groups among donors. The regression estimates that donors in the treatment group gave about $1.67 less, on average, than those in the control group — but this difference is small, statistically insignificant (p = 0.56), and could easily be explained by chance. Importantly, the treatment coefficient in this regression does not have a causal interpretation. Once we restrict the sample to donors only, we lose the balance created by random assignment. That is, the decision to donate is influenced by treatment, so analyzing only those who gave introduces selection bias. The treatment and control groups in this subset may differ in unobserved ways that affect donation size. Overall, this analysis supports the conclusion that the treatment increases the likelihood of giving, but does not significantly change the donation amount among those who do give. The main behavioral effect appears to be in motivating action, not increasing generosity.\n\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\n# Filter for donors only and add group labels\ndonors &lt;- data %&gt;%\n  filter(gave == 1) %&gt;%\n  mutate(group = ifelse(treatment == 1, \"Treatment\", \"Control\"))\n\n# Calculate mean donation for each group\ngroup_means &lt;- donors %&gt;%\n  group_by(group) %&gt;%\n  summarise(mean_amount = mean(amount, na.rm = TRUE))\n\n# Join means for plotting\ndonors &lt;- donors %&gt;%\n  left_join(group_means, by = \"group\")\n\n# Faceted histogram plot\nggplot(donors, aes(x = amount)) +\n  geom_histogram(binwidth = 5, fill = \"#3182bd\", color = \"white\", alpha = 0.9) +\n  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = mean_amount), color = \"#e34a33\", linetype = \"dashed\", linewidth = 1.2) +\n  facet_wrap(~ group, ncol = 2, scales = \"free_y\") +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Distribution of Donation Amounts Among Donors\",\n    x = \"Donation Amount ($)\",\n    y = \"Number of Donors\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 14) +\n  theme(\n    strip.text = element_text(size = 14, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 13),\n    axis.text = element_text(size = 12),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    panel.grid.major.x = element_blank()\n  )"

We generated 10,000 paired binary draws from the control and treatment distributions (with donation probabilities of 1.8% and 2.2%, respectively). For each pair, we calculated the difference in outcomes and then plotted the cumulative average of those differences. Early in the sequence, the cumulative average fluctuates due to random variation in small samples. However, as the number of observations increases, the cumulative average begins to stabilize and converge toward the true difference in population means — 0.004, shown by the red dashed line. This illustrates the Law of Large Numbers in action: as the sample size grows, sample averages tend to approach the population average. In the context of this experiment, it shows how small effects — like a 0.4 percentage point increase in donation likelihood — become visible and reliable only when we observe enough data.\n\n\nCentral Limit Theorem\n\n\nset.seed(42)\n\n# True probabilities\np_control &lt;- 0.018\np_treatment &lt;- 0.022\n\n# Sample sizes to simulate\nsample_sizes &lt;- c(50, 200, 500, 1000)\n\n# Function to simulate sample mean differences\nsimulate_diff_means &lt;- function(n, reps = 1000) {\n  replicate(reps, {\n    treat_sample &lt;- rbinom(n, 1, p_treatment)\n    control_sample &lt;- rbinom(n, 1, p_control)\n    mean(treat_sample) - mean(control_sample)\n  })\n}\n\n# Simulate distributions for each sample size\ndiffs_list &lt;- lapply(sample_sizes, simulate_diff_means)\n\n# Load for multi-panel plotting\npar(mfrow = c(2, 2))  # 2 rows, 2 columns\nfor (i in seq_along(diffs_list)) {\n  hist(diffs_list[[i]],\n       main = paste(\"Sample Size:\", sample_sizes[i]),\n       xlab = \"Mean Difference\",\n       col = \"lightblue\",\n       breaks = 30,\n       border = \"white\")\n  abline(v = 0, col = \"red\", lwd = 2, lty = \"dashed\")  # mark zero\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese four histograms visualize the Central Limit Theorem by showing the distribution of average differences in donation rates between treatment and control groups, simulated at different sample sizes: 50, 200, 500, and 1000. For each sample size, we ran 1000 simulations. In each iteration, we drew random samples from both treatment and control distributions (with donation probabilities of 2.2% and 1.8%, respectively), calculated the average difference, and plotted the results. As the sample size increases: The distribution becomes more bell-shaped and symmetric. The spread decreases, showing less variability in the average difference. The center of the distribution shifts away from zero, reflecting the true difference of 0.004. This demonstrates the Central Limit Theorem in action: as sample size increases, the sampling distribution of the mean difference becomes approximately normal, regardless of the original binary distribution. Also, zero is clearly in the tail (especially for n = 500 and n = 1000), providing evidence that the treatment effect is not due to chance. These plots reinforce the experimental finding — that even a small difference in probabilities becomes statistically distinguishable with enough data."
